        filter() is where your connector declares whether it "owns" a given file. `addr`, as in all other
         methods, is passed in without its prefix.
         For example, in the prefix autoschematic-sdk-python/examples:
         filter(widgets/foo.ron) -> FilterResponse.RESOURCE
         filter(widgets/bar.ron) -> FilterResponse.RESOURCE
         filter(widgets/bar.txt) -> FilterResponse.NONE

        There are other types of FilterResponses, but NONE and RESOURCE are the most common.
        If you return FilterResponse.CONFIG for a given file, the LSP will restart your connector
         whenever that file is modified, allowing you to reload config in init(). 
         
        `filter()` will be cached by the host, and should essentially be static (though it is allowed to depend on any 
         file marked as FilterResponse.CONFIG, so that the host can reload the connector when
         any such file changes).

        list() is rarely called except during import, and enumerating every possible resource addressable by a connector is likely to take time.
        `subpath` is used to constrain the search for performance. You can safely ignore the subpath variable. See other connectors for how to use `subpath` effectively.
